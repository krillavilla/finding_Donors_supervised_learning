## Project: Finding Donors for *CharityML* <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">Welcome to the first project of the Data Scientist Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `TODO` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! 
 
In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.   
 
&gt;**Note:** Please specify **WHICH VERSION OF PYTHON** you are using when submitting this notebook. Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">## Getting Started 
 
In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.  
 
The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _&quot;Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid&quot;_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `fnlwgt` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">---- 
## Exploring the Data 
Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `income`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than $50,000. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following: 
- The total number of records, `n_records` 
- The number of individuals making more than $50,000 annually, `n_greater_50k`. 
- The number of individuals making at most $50,000 annually, `n_at_most_50k`. 
- The percentage of individuals making more than $50,000 annually, `greater_percent`. 
 
**HINT:** You may need to look at the table above to understand how the `income` entries are formatted.  <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

## Preparing the Data 
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features 
A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: `capital-gain` and `capital-loss`.  
 
Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

</span><span class="s1">For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `capital-gain` and `capital-loss`, it is common practice to apply a [logarithmic transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)) on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of 0 is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above 0 to apply the the logarithm successfully. 
 
Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed.  <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

</span><span class="s1">### Normalizing Numerical Features 
In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `capital-gain` or `capital-loss` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below. 
 
Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

</span><span class="s1">### Implementation: Data Preprocessing 
 
From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _&quot;dummy&quot;_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`: 
 
|   | someFeature |                     
| :-: | :-: |                             
| 0 |  B  |   
| 1 |  C  | 
| 2 |  A  |   
 
We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`: 
 
|| someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C | 
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
|0| 0 | 1 | 0 | 
|1| 0 | 0 | 1 | 
|2| 1 | 0 | 0 | 
 
Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `income` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (&quot;&lt;=50K&quot; and &quot;&gt;50K&quot;), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as 0 and 1, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following: 
 - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `features_log_minmax_transform` data. 
 - Convert the target label `income_raw` to numerical entries. 
   - Set records with &quot;&lt;=50K&quot; to 0 and records with &quot;&gt;50K&quot; to 1. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

## Evaluating Model Performance 
In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Metrics and the Naive Predictor 
*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than $50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than $50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than $50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than $50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall: 
 
$$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot \text{precision} \right) + \text{recall}} $$ 
 
In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the $F_{0.5}$ score (or F-score for simplicity). 
 
Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most $50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than $50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *&quot;this person does not make more than $50,000&quot;* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than $50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors.  
 
 
#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall 
 
**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points). 
 
**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam. 
It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives (all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of 
 
$$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}} {\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}$$ 
 
**Recall (sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam. 
It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of 
 
$$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}} {\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}$$ 
 
For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions, like in our case, for example, if we had 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the remaining 98 weren't, accuracy is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam (including the 2 that were spam, but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam (all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score and the weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean when dealing with ratios). <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace 
* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `accuracy` and `fscore` to be used later. 
 
**Please note** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from. 
 
**HINT:**  
 
* When we have a model that always predicts 1 (i.e., the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives (TN) or False Negatives (FN) as we are not making any negative (0 value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision (True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value 1 that should have 0 becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total.  
* Our Recall score (True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section. 
In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: 
 - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics). 
 - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time. 
 - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`. 
   - Record the total prediction time. 
 - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set. 
 - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set. 
   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter! <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following: 
- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html). 
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`. 
 - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before. 
- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model. 
 - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`. 
 - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available! 
- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$). 
- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `scorer`, and store it in `grid_obj`. 
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.

## Feature Importance 
 
An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than $50,000. 
 
Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation 
When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why? <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">**Answer:** <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance 
Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm. 
 
In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following: 
 - Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from the three used earlier. 
 - Train the supervised model on the entire training set. 
 - Extract the feature importances using `.feature_importances_`. <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%

</span><span class="s1">### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance 
 
Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above $50,000.   
* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**? 
* If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts?  
* If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant? <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">**Answer:** <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Feature Selection 
How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*.  <hr class="ls0"></span><span class="s0">#%%
